abstract = {Recently, sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention due to the interest in mining opinions of social media users. Sentiment analysis consists in determining the polarity of a given text, i.e., its degree of positiveness or negativeness. Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis algorithms have been tailored to a specific language given the complexity of having a number of lexical variations and errors introduced by the people generating content. In this contribution, our aim is to provide a simple to implement and easy to use multilingual framework, that can serve as a baseline for sentiment analysis contests, and as a starting point to build new sentiment analysis systems. We compare our approach in eight different languages, three of them correspond to important international contests, namely, SemEval (English), TASS (Spanish), and SENTIPOLC (Italian). Within the competitions, our approach reaches from medium to high positions in the rankings; whereas in the remaining languages our approach outperforms the reported results.},

@article{Nava2024,
   abstract = {Collaborative competitions have gained popularity in the scientific and technological fields. These competitions involve defining tasks, selecting evaluation scores, and devising result verification methods. In the standard scenario, participants receive a training set and are expected to provide a solution for a held-out dataset kept by organizers. An essential challenge for organizers arises when comparing algorithms’ performance, assessing multiple participants, and ranking them. Statistical tools are often used for this purpose; however, traditional statistical methods often fail to capture decisive differences between systems’ performance. This manuscript describes an evaluation methodology for statistically analyzing competition results and competition. The methodology is designed to be universally applicable; however, it is illustrated using eight natural language competitions as case studies involving classification and regression problems. The proposed methodology offers several advantages, including off-the-shell comparisons with correction mechanisms and the inclusion of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we introduce metrics that allow organizers to assess the difficulty of competitions. Our analysis shows the potential usefulness of our methodology for effectively evaluating competition results.},
